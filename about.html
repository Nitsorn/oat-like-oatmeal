          <h5>JUST A FEW THINGS ABOUT ME.</h5>
          <p>
            Greetings visitors! Welcome to my...domain. Mwaha hahah.
          </p>
          <p>
            My name is Nitsorn Wongsajjathit, but I officially go by "<span class="bold">Oat</span>". <br /><br />I am currently a <span class="bold">front-end developer </span>at a homey web agency in the beautiful Vancouver, Canada. But let's rewind back a bit. What was I doing ... last year?
          </p>
          <h5>What happened <span style="font-style: italic">earlier </span> last year</h5>
          <p>
            A year ago, I was an engineering graduate struggling to find my place in the world. I'd just graduated from McGill with a bachelor's in chemical engineering. What is that, you ask? ...good question. yeah.
            I applied to this degree in 2011 thinking this was it! I wanted my work to matter, to affect the world on a large scale. I was supposed to be excited to get hired as a junior engineer somewhere remote like Fort McMurrey, work in a mine or an oil rig as a process engineer,and get paid unreasonably well. I mean, it's supposed to go according to plan, right? </p>


          <p><span style="font-style: italic">Nope, sorry bro.</span> - Life. </p>

          <p>The Candaian Oil Crash in 2015 had made it very difficult for me and my colleagues to find jobs. Chemical companies were not hiring. In fact, they were all laying people off. 5 months of daily job searches, and I find myself looking through at a cragslist posting for a drug manufacturing job. I don't know though, don't think ill be the one knocking yet. </p>

          <p>Should I keep applying? Should I look elsewhere around the world and leave my Canadian dream behind? What about grad school? There must be a better way! </p>

          <ol>
            I've had a previlege of working with an amazing professor during my last 2 years of undergrad. While the work was chemical engineering related, my role as a computational researcher was to develop a program to mimic nanoparticles in complex liquids. My success (surprising, I know) in this project had given me three things:
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              A scholarship from the ... people who give scholarships to students who do cool stuff,
            </li>
            <li>
              An offer from my professor to do Master's with him, and most valuable of all,
            </li>
            <li>
              A possibility that <span class="bold">coding</span> is my passion.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I'd spent the entirety of my 2015 summer learning how to code, in Montreal, Thailand, and even during my trip to Japan. I knew what I wanted to do, but I still had a lot of uncertainties since I was an international student. During the summer, I'd been in contact with a good friend of mine in Vancouver, who went to McGill for science and decided to pivot into backend web development after graduating in 2014. Coding in Vancouver? That sounds pretty nice.<br /><br /> Wait... I want that.
          </p>
          <h5>What happened <span style="font-style: italic">later</span> last year</h5>
          <p>
            In September, I'd decided to pack my bags and moved to Vancouver. I had no leads here, but then again, I had no leads anywhere else either. This was a new chapter of my life, and starting in a new environment gave me the opportunity to discover myself without the preassumed judgement of others. I was able to freely explore my new passion with no limitations. The rest is up to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier that year, I took an all-Canada trip with my parents when they came for my convocation. When we arrived at Vancouver, I ran into an old friend of mine from my years back in an Indian Boarding School, 10 years and halfway-around-the-world ago. When I told her about my ridiculous plan to come here for work, she offered a place for me to stay for the first two months. With a place to sleep at night, next step was to find some way to sustain myself financially. I had to find work. Fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was walking around Vancouver downtown a few days after I'd arrived, and came across this Japanese fusion restaurant where the service and the servers themselves were friendly and welcoming. I immediately when to the manager and asked him for a job. I told him about my plan in the city and what I aim to achieve, and even with no server experience, he gladly gave me the job and told me to work here until I find a job in tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            ...to be continued when I don't come back from work at like 8PM -_-'. so like next month.
